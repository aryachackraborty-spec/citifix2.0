🏆 Problem Statement

#Civic issues such as damaged roads, broken streetlights, water leakage, and sanitation problems often remain unresolved due to:

#Lack of public visibility

#No transparent escalation mechanism

#Weak communication between citizens and authorities

#Most complaint systems fail because individual voices are ignored.

💡 Our Solution:
#CitiFix 2.0 is a community-powered civic issue reporting platform where public participation drives accountability.
#Issues reported by users are upvoted by the community, and once an issue gains enough public support, it is automatically escalated to authorities through social media visibility.
🔥 At 50 community upvotes, an issue is automatically posted on X (Twitter), tagging the responsible department with full issue details and location.
